# Guideposts
Several new quests related to guideposts
## Context
[Guideposts](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:information%3Dguidepost) are touristic information infrastructure helping orientation. There use in . In Openstreetmap, there are described with the combination of tags `tourism=information` and `information=guidepost`. Signposts have recently faced a growing interest from outdoor-related openstreetmap contributors, as they are key elements for [Node Networks](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Node_Networks), which are used to map hiking path network, notably in [French Alps](https://knooppuntnet.nl/en/map/hiking?position=45.18829306,5.89704611,13). For these reasons, 

### Name
*Does this guideposts has a name* (y/n)
If yes, creates tag `name=`, if not add the tag `noname=yes`

### Elevation
Guideposts located in moutain areas often display elevation, which is widley tagged as `ele` in Openstreetmap, unit is meters.

*Is the elevation displayed on this guideposts* (y/n)
If yes, elevation should be asked, in **meters** (this quest would be disabled by default in countries using imperial units for elevation) and tag `ele=` created accordingly. 
If no, a tag describing lack of elevation data should be added. To my knowledge, no such tag is widely adopted for such a prupose, so here are two possible candidates:
- `noele=yes`, used [68 times](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/noele), inspired from `noname=yes`
- `ele:signed=no`, used [10 times](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/search?q=ele%3Asigned%3Dno), which is directly inspired by tag `name:signed=no` largely popularized by Streetcomplete. My personnal preference goes to this one which is more emphising on the *lack of elevation display* than a *lack of elevation*. Community input is very welcome.
